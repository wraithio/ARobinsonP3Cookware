### Peer Review:
**Name**: Gianpaolo Reinares
**Comments**: The Site Looks Great; Responsiveness Works for all sizes;
> Footer and Promo are the wrong color; Should be #1E2C20
> In 'New Arrivals' could use a bit of margin between the entries;
> In the Footer, it could use a bit of margin on dektop mode as it is a bit cramped
> Don't know if you have enough time, but try looking into the 'Offcanvas' section of 'Navbar' in getbootstrap.com *no time* -__-
> Also, check out 'overflow: hidden' for pictures that zoom in.
> Overall everything looks good, site is responsive, I like how the best sellers arrange themselves within certain breakpoints. Great work!
